# Cards Sample

This is a sample of a simple Agent hosted on a Python web service. This serves as an example of how to create rich cards to enhance your conversation design.

## Prerequisites

-  [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.9 or higher
-  [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) (for local development)

## Local Setup

### Configuration

1. [Create an Azure Bot](https://aka.ms/AgentsSDK-CreateBot)
   - Record the Application ID, the Tenant ID, and the Client Secret for use below
  
1. Configuring the token connection in the Agent settings
    1. Open the `env.TEMPLATE` file in the root of the sample project, rename it to `.env` and configure the following values:
      1. Set the **CONNECTIONS__SERVICE_CONNECTION__SETTINGS__CLIENTID** to the AppId of the bot identity.
      2. Set the **CONNECTIONS__SERVICE_CONNECTION__SETTINGS__CLIENTSECRET** to the Secret that was created for your identity. *This is the `Secret Value` shown in the AppRegistration*.
      3. Set the **CONNECTIONS__SERVICE_CONNECTION__SETTINGS__TENANTID** to the Tenant Id where your application is registered.
 
1. Run `dev tunnels`. See [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

1. Take note of the url shown after `Connect via browser:`

1. On the Azure Bot, select **Settings**, then **Configuration**, and update the **Messaging endpoint** to `{tunnel-url}/api/messages`

### Running the Agent

1. Start the Agent using `python -m src.main`

1. Open this folder from your IDE or Terminal of preference
1. (Optional but recommended) Set up virtual environment and activate it.
1. Install dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run in localhost, anonymous mode

1. Start the application

```sh
python -m src.main
```

At this point you should see the message 

```text
======== Running on http://localhost:3978 ========
```

The agent is ready to accept messages.

## Accessing the Agent

### Using the Agent in WebChat

1. Go to your Azure Bot Service resource in the Azure Portal and select **Test in WebChat**
