# M365 Agents and Copilot Studio Pro-Code ecosystem
Copilot Studio, the M365 Agents SDK, and the surrounding ecosystem spans multiple GitHub repos. This section describes each area and the associated Repos. 

The [Copilot Studio Blog] contains up-to-date information about the latest releases and features across both the low-code and pro-code ecosystem. 


## Samples and Best Practices
Copilot Studio directly supports many code-first development experiences and extensibility points. Samples such as Single Sign On, consumption of REST APIs, and customizing the end-user UX offer a good getting started point.

## M365 Agents SDK
The Microsoft 365 Agents SDK simplifies building full stack, multichannel, trusted agents for platforms including M365, Teams, Copilot Studio, and WebChat. The M365 Agents SDK is code-first solution that enables developers to build and interact with Agents using .NET, JavaScript, or Python. 

The source for the client libraries exists in repositories for each language. This repository is meant to be a jumping off point into those language specific repositories. Issues related to a specific language should be opened in the corresponding repository while cross cutting issues should be opened in the [Agents Repository].
